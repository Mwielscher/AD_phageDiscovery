> **_Abstract:_**  In this metagenomic investigation we assembled viral sequences from skin swaps of healthy individuals and atopic dermatitis patients (AD). We found a total of 13586 potential viral contigs distributed over 182 metagenome samples from 35 participants, which could be assigned to 162 putative phage genomes. There was high sequence heterogeneity within novel discovered viral like particles (VLP). Shannon diversity index for VLPs did not correlate with AD induced inflammation, however we found 28 VLPs with significant association between AD induced inflammation and phage abundance. qPCR validation of 3 VLPs showed an that the observed association between inflammation and phage abundance was independent of each phage host bacterium abundance. We observed a high fraction of integrated prophages but also detected lytic phages that would be suitable for phage treatment in AD patients.

 The scripts to perform the analyses presented in the manuscript are deposited in this repository. These are custom scripts, which were  run on my local destop computer or designed to run on a [SGE cluster](http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/manuals.html). Any script may serve a building block for a process in any workflow language.
